## Question 1: Variables and Input/Output (10 points)

Write a program that:
- Takes user's name and age as input
- Calculates birth year (assume current year is 2025)
- Prints: 'Hello [name], you were born in [year]'

**Sample Input:** Name: Rahul, Age: 22  
**Sample Output:** Hello Rahul, you were born in 2003

## Question 2: Conditional Statements (15 points)

Write a program that takes a number as input and:
- If divisible by both 3 and 5: print 'FizzBuzz'
- If divisible by 3 only: print 'Fizz'
- If divisible by 5 only: print 'Buzz'
- Otherwise: print the number itself

**Test with:** 15, 9, 10, 7  
**Expected:** FizzBuzz, Fizz, Buzz, 7

## Question 3: Loops and Pattern Printing (15 points)

Create a right triangle pattern using nested loops:

**Input:** Number of rows (n)

**Pattern for n=4:**
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
```

**Hint:** Use nested for loops

## Question 4: Lists and Data Processing (15 points)

Given a list of numbers: `[12, 7, 23, 8, 19, 4, 15]`

Write a program to:
- Find and print all even numbers
- Calculate and print the sum of odd numbers
- Find the maximum number (without using max() function)

**Expected Output:**
```
Even numbers: [12, 8, 4]
Sum of odd numbers: 64
Maximum number: 23
```

## Question 5: Comprehensive Problem (20 points)

Create a simple grade calculator:
- Input: Student name and 5 subject marks
- Calculate total and percentage
- Assign grade based on percentage:
  - 90-100: A+
  - 80-89: A
  - 70-79: B
  - 60-69: C
  - Below 60: F
- Print: Name, Total, Percentage, Grade

**Sample Input:** Name: Priya, Marks: 85, 92, 78, 88, 90  
**Sample Output:** Priya - Total: 433, Percentage: 86.6%, Grade: A
